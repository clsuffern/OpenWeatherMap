# Weather API

The open source project that I chose to look into is called **weeWx**. 
This project supports many private weather stations that users set up
at their homes.  It enables plotting of trends and creation of visually
pleasing displays to publish their home weather reports. It also can
upload your weather reports to sites such as WeatherUnderground and
PWSweather.com. The project began in 2009 and is currently quite active.

# Development

There is a Google forum were users can ask questions and get support for using the 
code.  The group seems to be pretty active as there were several posts from 
today. A second forum (found at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/weewx-development)
focuses on development issues and serves as a platform for reporting bugs.   

# Download & Code
