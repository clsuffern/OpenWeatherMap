#Weather API
###The open source project that I chose to look into is called 'OpenWeatherMap'. 
###This project offers a Weather API.
=============================
##Development
###The company has a group of developers and it's unclear if they supply all
###the code used for their weather dissemination.  You can download code
###from their **Widgets Constructor** site.  Questions and to report a bug
###can be done through this website: https://openweathermap.desk.com/customer/portal/questions/new.
